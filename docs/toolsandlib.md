# 🛠️ Development Environment & Tools

* **Git Bash**
  A command-line interface for Windows that provides a Unix-like experience. It serves as the primary terminal for version control operations (Git), script execution, and navigating the project structure efficiently.

* **Conda**
  An open-source package management and environment management system. It is used to create isolated environments for this project, ensuring that dependencies and libraries do not conflict with other system-wide installations.

* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
  The integrated development environment (IDE) chosen for this project. It provides robust support for Python debugging, syntax highlighting, and integrated terminal access, streamlined by extensions for Python and Jupyter.

## 🐍 Core Technology

* **Python 3.8**
  The underlying programming language for the application. Version 3.8 was selected for its stability and broad compatibility with modern machine learning and data science libraries.

* **LangChain**
  The primary framework for developing applications powered by language models. It acts as the orchestration layer, connecting LLMs (Large Language Models) to other sources of data and allowing us to chain together commands for complex reasoning tasks.

* **Pinecone Vector Database**
  A fully managed, cloud-native vector database. It is used to store and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings, enabling efficient semantic search and long-term memory capabilities for our AI models.
